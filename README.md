# Comics App Using NextJS Framework


## Overview

Next.js is a framework that renders react applications on the server. This means when we create a normal react app (using create-react-app for example) and load it to the browser, all the content is created by client-side javascript. Hence users or devices that don't have javascript will not be able to access your app.

## API

Used  [XKCD API](https://xkcd.com/json.html) to fetch comics and metadata automatically,
using the JSON interface.

Those files contain, in a plaintext and easily-parsed format: comic titles,
URLs, post dates, transcripts (when available), and other metadata.
